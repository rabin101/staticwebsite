        <h1>Google</h1>
        <P>This website has become an integral part of our digital life. Yes we know what this site does and how we can access it
            but many of us are not aware of what this site actually represents and its inner workings and mechanism.
            You must have noticed something like http://www.google.com on your web browser when you try to access google.
            This page is all about what that is, that you see. Different entities have to come together and work in harmony to load the page you asked for.
</p>
<br>
<p>To understand how a website work, first we need to learn about certain elements. They are;
</p>
<br>
<p>-URL(Uniform Resource Locator)</p>
<p> -URI(Uniform Resource Identifier)</p>
<p>  -HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)</p>
<p>  -HTTPS(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)</p>
<p>   -TLS(Transport Layer Security)</p>
<br>
<p>There are links down below to dive into these elements.</p>

            HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (https) is basically an extention of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which main purpose is to make communication safe and <em>secure</em> over the internet.
             HTTPS uses encrypted Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
             based, communication protocol, hence, it is also called as <em>HTTP over TLS.</em>

        <p>
            The main objective for the existence of HTTPS are making sure the accessed webpage is <em>authentic</em>, and to protect the <em>privacy</em> and integrity of transitioning data through the internet.
             It gives our data protection against <em>(man-in-the-middleattacks)</em>, and all sorts of protection like eavesdropping and tampering, bidirectional encryption of communication between a receiptient and server.
              Although https does require a third party application to sign the server's side digital certificate.

            Because of all the security benefits, https are often prefered over the the http. 
            It has enable us to feel secure while browsing which has now become really crucial in the digital world we reside in, these days.
            Especially when tech companies are spending billions of dollars just to secure their clients privacy from all sorts of digital encroachment.

            Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that specializes in providing data security over a computer network.
             TLS Protocol serves as a tool to provide privacy and data integrity among computer applications.

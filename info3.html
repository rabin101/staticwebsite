     <p>  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is basically, to put it in a simpler term, a rule or a structure, by the help
        of which, we can fetch resources,such as HTML files. We can call it the <em>backbone or the foundation</em> of any data that goes through the web.
        When <em>recipient</em>, usually the Web browser, initiates the requests, it (HTTP) comes as client-server protocol and a complete document is re-arranged from
        various sub-document that were fetched, for example images, videos, scripts, text, layout description and so on and so forth, and put forward to appear on your screen.
         <p>
            <br>
          HTTP clients, in general, use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections to exchange information with servers. 
          Recipients and servers exchange individual meassages to communicate as opposed to a data stream.
          The messages sent by the receiptients, usually a web browser, are termed as <em>requests</em> 
          and the messages that get sent back as an answer are called <em>responses.</em>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As mentioned earlier, HTTP is client-server protocol where requests are sent by one entity,the user or a proxy in its place. 
            Although most of the times the user is a web browser, but it can also be some other entity for instance an AI that crawls the web to populate and maintain a search engine index.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
         There are numerous aspects of HTTP that are advantageous for us like: it is very simple and human readable, facilitating easier testing for developers, and very less complexity for newcomers.
           It is extensible protocol so there is room to bring new functionality.

            A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) also more widely known as web address is a reference to a web resource that has responsibility
            to fetch its location on a computer network and also specializes on
            its function of retrieving it. URL is a type of URI that come along mostly to reference <em>web page(http)</em> and at the same time is also useful for file transfer like email <em>(mailto)</em>,
            database access <em>(JDBC)</em>, and various other applications.
        </p>

            Web browsers mostly display the URL of any web page on its address bar which looks something like, (http://www.nepal.com/index.html) which includes a protocol <em>(http)</em>,
             a <em> host name (nepal.com)</em>, and a <em>file name (index.html)</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is alot of complex actions that come into play, when you enter a URL
            into a web browser. URL acts as a user friendly stand-in for an <em>IP address</em>, 
            which is a string of characters with the utility of serving as the webpage's actual location
             on the internet. Then with the help of tool called a <em>Domain Name Server (DNS)</em>, your
             browser looks up the IP address. The DNS can be compared to a phone book,but for a web browser.

            The DNS system can be described as hierarchial and decentralized system for the resurces on the internet.
            It primiraly translates the domain name into numerical IP address for it to be processed, following certain Protocol
            to map them into internet resources. The DNS also works in specifying the technical functionality of the database service following DNS protocol, a detailed and specified data structure and data communication in DNS, within Internal Protocol Suite.

        <P>A URI(Unique Resource Identifier) is basically a particular set of characters that is used by webpage technologies to locate
           its logical or physical resource. URI is used to locate almost everything including information on people, places,
           address or resources that has to with text, books, webpages and so on.
</p>
<br>
<P>
    To break it down even more, its an official name for all those things you see everytime on a webpage for example http://www.google.com/,which is the 
    URI for the home page of search engine GOOGLE. Something you need to know, above examples were called URLs(Uniform Resource Locator) 
in the early days but was changed later. The term URI and URL are often interchangebly, but we should always keep in our mind
that there is a subtle difference between them.
</P>
<br>
<p>
    A URI is  an <em>Identifier</em> of a specific resource, like a book or a page or a document whereas A URL is a special
    type of identifier <em>which also tells you how to access it,</em> such as HTTPs, FTP etc.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    URIs are responsible for enabling certain protocols over the internet to conduct the interactions between and
    among various resources. And to that it takes the form of strings of characters that serves as an identifier and also names 
    and addresses to connected devices and other resources. URI has two specialization known as URL(Uniform Resource Locator)
     and URN(Uniform Resource Name).
